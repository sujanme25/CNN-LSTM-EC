# CNN-LSTM-EC
CNN+LSTM with Error Compensation
This example introduces an error_model that predicts errors based on the absolute errors between the true values and the original predictions. These predicted errors are then used to adjust the original predictions, creating compensated predictions. Adjust the architectures and hyperparameters as needed based on your specific data and requirements
